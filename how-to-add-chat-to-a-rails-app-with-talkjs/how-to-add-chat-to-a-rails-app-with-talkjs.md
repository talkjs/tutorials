# How to add chat to a Rails app with TalkJS

[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), popularly known as Ruby on Rails, is a fullstack web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It follows the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm providing a database (model), web pages (view), and services (controller).

This tutorial shows you how to use TalkJS's [JavaScript SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/Getting_Started/JavaScript_SDK/) to add chat to your Rails application:

  <figcaption>Demo of the chat feature.</figcaption>
</figure>

To follow along with the tutorial, you'll need:

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login). TalkJS provides a ready-to-use chat client for your application. Your account gives you access to TalkJS's free development environment.
- A [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installation.

You may also already have a Rails project that you want to add TalkJS to. If not, we'll walk you through how to install Rails and set up a new project in the next section.

All the code for this example can be found in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/ruby/rails-talkjs).

## Install and set up Rails

We'll start by installing Rails. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gem install rails
```

Now, go to the folder where you want to create your new project. Inside the directory, run:

```bash
rails new rails-talkjs
```

This creates a new folder called `rails-talkjs` inside the directory you're currently in. Move into the folder by running `cd rails-talkjs`. To test your app, you can run:

```bash
rails server
```

This starts the development server at `localhost:3000`.

## Create a user model

Next, we must create a model for storing user data. To do this, run:

```bash
rails generate model User name:string email:string photoUrl:string id:string role:string
```

This creates a migration file inside the `/db/migrate` folder of your project. Note that, by default, Rails creates models with an integer `id` field. We're going to use a string `id` field since it's easier to create TalkJS users. To do this, open the migration file and alter it as shown:

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :users, id: false do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email
      t.string :photoUrl
      t.string :id, primary_key: true
      t.string :role

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

This ensures that the default id field is not created and the one we created is used as the primary key. Note that `7.1` here is the version of `ActiveRecord` used to create the migrations â€“ if you're adding TalkJS to your own project you might see a different version.

Now, run the migration script to create the table:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Add user data

Next, we'll create some user data. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll store it in a SQLite database. SQLite is included with Rails, so this means we can get started without installing anything else. If you want to use a different database in your project, see the [configuration guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.1/configuring.html#connection-preference).

There's a file called `seeds.rb` inside the `db` folder. Open it and add the following:

```ruby
User.create(name: "John", email: "christopher.garcia@example.com", id: "john.garcia", photoUrl: "https://talkjs.com/new-web/avatar-2.jpg", role: "default")
User.create(name: "Leroy", email: "leroy.stanley@example.com", id: "leroy.stanley", photoUrl: "https://talkjs.com/new-web/avatar-3.jpg", role: "default")
User.create(name: "Ray", email: "ray.mitchelle@example.com", id: "ray.mitchelle", photoUrl: "https://talkjs.com/new-web/avatar-4.jpg", role: "default")
```

These are commands to create three users with the fields specified. We've used fields that match those of a [TalkJS user](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Concepts/Users/) so that it is straightforward to create them and start conversations. To add this to our database, run:

```bash
rails db:seed
```

To make it easier to test the app out, the example code for this tutorial includes a [`seeds.rb` file](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/ruby/rails-talkjs/db/seeds.rb) that creates users in the database. You can run it using the same command shown above.

## Add a controller

Now we're going to create a controller called `Chat`. To do this, run:

```bash
rails generate controller Chat
```

This creates a new file called `chat_controller.rb` inside the `rails-talkjs/app/controllers` folder. It also creates a new empty folder called `chat` inside `rails-talkjs/app/views`. Now, go inside the `chat_controller.rb` file and add the following:

```ruby
class ChatController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
    gon.users = @users
  end

  def conversation
    @users = User.all
    gon.mainUser = User.find_by(id: 'john.garcia')
    gon.users = @users
  end
end
```

This creates two actions inside the `chat_controller`. The first one, called `index`, assigns all the users from the database to a variable `@users`. This is then also assigned to the `gon.users` variable. Don't worry about `gon` just yet, we'll get to that in a later section.

The second action does the same thing, but also assigns another variable called `gon.mainUser` with the value of the user John Garcia. In the next section, we're going to add two views for the two actions we just created.

## Add a view

A view in a Rails application handles the presentation of the application's data. We use an extension called `.erb` that stands for Embedded Ruby. It is a mix of HTML and Ruby. This is similar to `.jsx` that is a mix of JavaScript and HTML. We're going to create two `erb` files. The first one corresponds to the initial screen where the user can make a chat selection. The second one displays the actual chat itself.

### Index view

Inside the empty `chat` folder in `rails-talkjs/app/views`, create a new file called `index.html.erb`. Add the following code inside it:

```html
<div class = "button-container">
<h3 class="index-title">John's chats</h3>
<%= button_to 'Chat with Leroy', chat_conversation_path(@users.second.id), method: 'get', class: 'chat-button' %>
<%= button_to 'Chat with Ryan', chat_conversation_path(@users.third.id), method: 'get', class: 'chat-button' %>
</div>
```

This contains a `div` that houses a title and two buttons. The buttons are created using Rails' [Action View URL Helpers](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.1.3.4/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-button_to).

### Conversation view

Next, create another file called `conversation.html.erb` and add the following code inside it.

```html
<%= javascript_import_module_tag "conversation" %>
<div class = "main-container">
<%= content_tag :button, type: 'button', class: 'chat-button', onclick: "window.location='#{chat_path}'" do %>
  <!-- SVG left arrow icon -->
  <svg
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;
    width="16"
    height="16"
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    fill="none"
    stroke="currentColor"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    stroke-width="2"
  >
    <path d="m15 18-6-6 6-6" fill="none" />
  </svg>
  John's chats
<% end %>
<div id="talkjs-container">
  <i>Loading chat...</i>
</div>
</div>
```

The first line is to use the `conversation.js` file with this view. We'll be creating this in the section where we include TalkJS. Next, we have a `div` that houses a button and another `div` to add the TalkJS chat. On clicking the button, we go back to the `index` view.

## Install `gon`

Next, we'll pass our data to the views. We'll use the [`gon`](https://github.com/gazay/gon) gem, which makes it easier to use Rails variables inside JavaScript.

Open your `Gemfile` and add a new entry:

```bash
gem "gon"
```

Then, run the command to install the gem:

```bash
bundle install
```

This installs `gon` in your project. To start using it, we must make one more change. Go to the `application.html.erb` file present inside `rails-talkjs/app/views/layouts`. Just under the `<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>`, add:

```ruby
<%= Gon::Base.render_data %>
```

## Include TalkJS

It's now time to add TalkJS to our project. TalkJS provides pre-built chat UIs that allow you to quickly add chat to your application. In this tutorial, we'll use the [Chatbox](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Chat_UI_Modes/The_Chatbox/) UI.

We'll use TalkJS's [JavaScript SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/JavaScript_Chat_SDK/) to add the chatbox. Go to the `application.html.erb` file once again and add the following under the line you previously added:

```html
<script>
  (function (t, a, l, k, j, s) {
    s = a.createElement("script");
    s.async = 1;
    s.src = "https://cdn.talkjs.com/talk.js";
    a.head.appendChild(s);
    k = t.Promise;
    t.Talk = {
      v: 2,
      ready: {
        then: function (f) {
          if (k)
            return new k(function (r, e) {
              l.push([f, r, e]);
            });
          l.push([f]);
        },
        catch: function () {
          return k && new k();
        },
        c: l,
      },
    };
  })(window, document, []);
</script>
```

Then, create a file called `conversation.js` inside `rails-talkjs/app/javascript`. Add the following code:

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const users = gon.users;
  const mainUser = gon.mainUser;
  
  const pathSegments = window.location.pathname.split("/");
  const name = pathSegments[pathSegments.length - 1];
  const otherUser = users.find((user) => user.id === name);

  Talk.ready.then(function () {
    const me = new Talk.User({
      id: mainUser.id,
      name: mainUser.name,
      email: mainUser.email,
      photoUrl: mainUser.photoUrl,
      role: mainUser.role,
    });

    const other = new Talk.User({
      id: otherUser.id,
      name: otherUser.name,
      email: otherUser.email,
      photoUrl: otherUser.photoUrl,
      role: otherUser.role,
    });

    window.talkSession = new Talk.Session({
      appId: "<APP_ID>",
      me: me,
    });

    const conversation = talkSession.getOrCreateConversation(
      Talk.oneOnOneId(me, other)
    );
    conversation.setParticipant(me);
    conversation.setParticipant(other);

    let chatbox = talkSession.createChatbox();
    chatbox.mount(document.getElementById("talkjs-container"));
    chatbox.select(conversation);
  });
});
```

Remember the variables `gon.users` and `gon.mainUser` we had in the `chat_controller`? With the help of the `gon` dependency, we're able to use them inside our JavaScript file. This code sets up a conversation between the main user (John Garcia) and the other user. The user data is provided by the `chat` view. For more explanation of the TalkJS code, see our [getting started guide](https://talkjs.com/docs/Getting_Started/JavaScript_SDK/1_On_1_Chat/).

You'll need to replace `<APP_ID>` with your app ID, which you can find on the **Settings** tab of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard).

Lastly, we must add an entry inside the `importmap.rb` file inside the `rails-talkjs/config` folder to load this module. Go to the file and add the following line at the very end:

```ruby
pin "conversation", preload: false
```

## Add routes

The penultimate step is to add routes. Open the `routes.rb` file inside the `rails-talkjs/config` folder. Then, replace the code with the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'chat', to: 'chat#index'
  get 'chat/:id', to: 'chat#conversation', as: 'chat_conversation'
  # other routes
end
```

This specifies that if we go to the `/chat` path, it should open the `index` view and if we select a conversation, then it opens the `conversation` view.

## Style the chat

Lastly, we need to add some styles to make our application look good. In Rails, CSS files need to be added inside the `app/assets/stylesheets` folder. There's already an `application.css` file that you can use. We don't need to provide additional configuration for Rails to use this. Open the file and add the following styles:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

h1, h3 {
  text-align: center;
  color: #333;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

#talkjs-container i {
  color: #888;
}

.button-container {
  width: 415px;
  margin: 30px auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  border: 1px solid #888;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.main-container {
  width: 415px;
  margin: 30px auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

#talkjs-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 500px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.chat-button {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  margin-bottom: 10px; 
  padding: 10px 20px;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #007bff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.chat-button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

You can view the styles we're using for our example in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/ruby/rails-talkjs/app/stylesheets/application.css). After applying these styles your chat should look something like this:

<!-- Add 2-chatbox.jpg -->

<figure class="kg-image-card">
  <img class="kg-image" src="<URL>" alt="The chatbox with styling added. The chatbox is centred and the button is styled to match TalkJS's design."/>
  <figcaption>The chatbox with styling added</figcaption>
</figure>

## Summary

You now have a working demonstration of how to integrate TalkJS with Rails! To recap, in this tutorial we have:

- Created a Rails model corresponding to a TalkJS user and stored some data in a SQLite database
- Created a controller with two actions
- Set up routes
- Added a chatbox to the template with TalkJS's JavaScript SDK
- Styled the template
