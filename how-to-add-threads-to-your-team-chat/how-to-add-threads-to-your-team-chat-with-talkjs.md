# How to add threads to your team chat with TalkJS

This tutorial builds on [How to use TalkJS to create a team chat with channels](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-use-talkjs-to-create-a-team-chat-with-channels/), which shows you how to use TalkJS's [React SDK](https://talkjs.com/docs/Getting_Started/React/) to make a collaborative chat with DMs and discussion channels, similar to Slack or Teams.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to add reply threads:

</figure>

By default, TalkJS instead supports replying to messages within a conversation, in a similar style to replies in a messaging app like WhatsApp. However, TalkJS is flexible enough to let you build reply threads as a feature yourself.

To try it out, see the [interactive chat demo](https://talkjs.com/demo/team-chat/) on our website.

We'll take you through the following steps:

- Adding a **Reply in thread** message action
- Adding a **Back** button
- Adding a link to the thread with a reply count

To do this, we'll make full use of TalkJS's customization options, including [custom themes](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Themes/The_Theme_Editor/), [custom message actions](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Message_Features/Message_Actions/), [custom data](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Concepts/Conversations/#custom), [webhooks](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Webhooks/) and the [REST API](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/REST_API/Getting_Started/Introduction/).

You can see the complete example code in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/team-chat-with-threads) for this tutorial.

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login). TalkJS provides a ready-to-use chat client for your application. Your account gives you access to TalkJS's free development environment.
- An existing team chat to add reply threads to. In this tutorial we'll be using our React-based [team chat example](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/remote-work-demo) as the starting point, but you could adapt the same ideas to a different framework.
- An installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) along with the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager. Weâ€™ll use this to create our backend server.

## Set up the project

In this section, we'll get the basic structure of the project set up.

### Set up the team chat

If you haven't already worked through the [How to use TalkJS to create a team chat with channels](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-use-talkjs-to-create-a-team-chat-with-channels/) tutorial, follow the instructions in the [example repo README](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/remote-work-demo) to clone the project, install dependencies and run the app.

### Create the backend server

To create new threads, you'll need to call TalkJS's REST API. You'll need to do this from a backend server to avoid exposing your TalkJS secret key. In this tutorial we'll use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), but feel free to use your favorite web server library instead.

Add a new `backend` directory to your project. Inside `backend`, initialize the project:

```sh
npm init
```

This will add a `package.json` file to your directory. Add the following lines:

```json
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
```

Then install the packages that we'll need:

```sh
npm install express cors
```

As well as Express, this installs the `cors` package, which we use to set up CORS support on the server.

Next, create a new `server.js` file inside `backend` and add the following:

```js
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";

const appId = "<APP_ID>";
const secretKey = "<SECRET_KEY>";

const basePath = "https://api.talkjs.com";

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(3001, () => console.log("Server is up"));
```

Replace `<APP_ID>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` with the values in the **Settings** page of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard).

Now, run the server with:

```sh
npm start
```

We'll add calls to the REST API in later sections.

## Add the "Reply in thread" feature

In this section, we'll create a **Reply in thread** [message action](/Features/Message_Features/Message_Actions/) that creates a new thread for that message, or takes you to the thread if it already exists.

The thread will be a standard TalkJS [conversation](/Reference/Concepts/Conversations/), with the message you're replying to duplicated at the top as a [system message](/Reference/Concepts/System_Messages/).

### Replace the "Reply" action with a custom "Reply in thread" action

First we'll remove the standard **Reply** message action and create a custom **Reply in thread** action instead. To do this:

1.  Go to the **Chat UI** tab of the TalkJS dashboard.
2.  Select the "default" role.
3.  In **Actions and permissions** > **Built-in message actions**, set **Reply** to **None**.
4.  In **Actions and permissions** > **Custom message actions**, create a new action with a name of "replyInThread" and a label of "Reply in thread", available to all messages for users with write permission.

### Add an event handler for the "Reply in thread" action

To listen for the new `replyInThread` event in your frontend code, pass the [`onCustomMessageAction` prop](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/React_SDK/Components/Chatbox/#event-props) to your `Chatbox`component in `TeamChat.jsx`:

```jsx
const replyInThread = (event) => {
  console.log(event);
};

<Chatbox
  // ... other props ...
  onCustomMessageAction={replyInThread}
/>;
```

Now when you select the **Reply in thread** message action, you should see the event data logged to your browser console.

### Create the new thread conversation in the frontend

Next we'll update the `replyInThread` function to create a new conversation which we'll use as our thread. We'll give the conversation an ID of `replyto_<MESSAGE_ID>`, where `<MESSAGE_ID>` is the ID of the message it's replying to.

<div style="background-color: #EFF; padding: 15px;">

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> In the rest of this tutorial we'll refer to the message we're replying to as the <strong>parent message</strong>, and its associated conversation as the <strong>parent conversation</strong>. </p>

</div>

Update your `replyInThread` function in `TeamChat.jsx` with:

```js
const replyInThread = (event) => {
  console.log(event);

  if (session?.isAlive) {
    let thread = session.getOrCreateConversation("replyto_" + event.message.id);
    const me = new Talk.User(talkJsConfig.userId);
    thread.setParticipant(me);

    if (chatboxRef.current?.isAlive) {
      chatboxRef.current.select(thread);
    }

    setCurrentConversation({
      id: "replyto_" + event.message.id,
      avatar: "",
      subject: "Replies",
    });
  }
};
```

We also set the current conversation, which is used by the `ConversationListItem` component to highlight the relevant conversation in the channel list.

### Pass message action data to the server

We can create the conversation for the thread on the frontend, but we'll need a backend server to deal with other parts of creating the new thread, like copying across the message that the thread is replying to.

First, we'll pass event data from the **Reply in thread** message action to the backend server. Create a new `postMessageData` function to call a `/new-thread` endpoint (which we'll create below):

```jsx
async function postMessageData(
  messageId,
  conversationId,
  messageText,
  participants
) {
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3001/new-thread", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      messageId,
      conversationId,
      messageText,
      participants,
    }),
  });
}
```

Now update your `replyInThread` function to replace your `console.log(event)` call with a call to `postMessageData`:

```js
const replyInThread = (event) => {
  postMessageData(
    event.message.id,
    event.message.conversation.id,
    event.message.body,
    Object.keys(event.message.conversation.participants)
  );

  // ...
};
```

This posts the message ID, conversation ID, message text and a list of participants to a `/newThread` endpoint in the backend server you created earlier. Let's create the endpoint next in `server.js`:

```js
// Endpoint to create new sub-conversation (thread)
app.post("/new-thread", async (req, res) => {
  // Get details of the message we'll reply to
  const parentMessageId = req.body.messageId;
  const parentConvId = req.body.conversationId;
  const parentMessageText = req.body.messageText;
  const parentParticipants = req.body.participants;

  console.log("Parent message id: " + parentMessageId);
  console.log("Parent conversation id: " + parentConvId);
  console.log("Parent message text: " + parentMessageText);
  console.log("Parent message participants: " + parentParticipants);
});
```

Restart your server and try clicking the **Reply in thread** message action again. You should see the event data logged to your server console. We'll update this endpoint later to create the new thread.

### Create the new thread

Next we'll extend this endpoint to use the data to create a new thread if one doesn't already exist, instead of just logging it to the console. Update the `/new-thread` endpoint as follows:

```js
// Endpoint to create new sub-conversation (thread)
app.post("/new-thread", async (req, res) => {
  // Get details of the message we'll reply to
    const parentMessageId = req.body.messageId;
    const parentConvId = req.body.conversationId;
    const parentMessageText = req.body.messageText;
    const parentParticipants = req.body.participants;

    const response = await getMessages(parentMessageId);
    const messages = await response.data;

    // Create a message with the text of the parent message if one doesn't already exist
    if (!messages.data?.length) {
      await handleThreadCreation(
        parentMessageId,
        parentConvId,
        parentParticipants,
        parentMessageText
      );
    }
  }
});
```

Here we're calling new `getMessages` and `handleThreadCreation` functions, which we'll create next.

We use the `getMessages` function to check if there's already an existing conversation with messages:

```js
// Get messages in a given thread (sub-conversation)
async function getMessages(messageId) {
  // Sometimes getOrCreateConversation gets called slightly out of sync with this backend,
  // which causes the thread functionality to break, so we make a "put" call
  // to create the conversation if it doesn't already exist

  await fetch(`${basePath}/v1/${appId}/conversations/replyto_${messageId}/`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
    },
  });

  const response = await fetch(
    `${basePath}/v1/${appId}/conversations/replyto_${messageId}/messages`,
    {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
      },
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();
  if (!data) {
    return { data: [] };
  } else {
    return { data };
  }
}
```

This function first calls the [create or update conversation](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/REST_API/Conversations/#setting-conversation-data) endpoint of the REST API to ensure that the conversation exists, in case there are syncing issues with the frontend. It then calls the [list messages from a conversation](https://docs-add-components-getting-started-react.talkjsonprem.com/docs/Reference/REST_API/Messages/#list-messages-from-a-conversation) REST endpoint.

Then add the `handleThreadCreation` function, along with the `createThread` and `duplicateParentMessageText` functions that it calls:

```js
async function createThread(parentMessageId, parentConvId, participants) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${basePath}/v1/${appId}/conversations/replyto_${parentMessageId}`,
    {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
      },

      body: JSON.stringify({
        participants: participants,
        subject: "Replies",
        custom: {
          parentConvId: parentConvId,
          parentMessageId: parentMessageId,
        },
      }),
    }
  );
  return response.json();
}

// Send message to the new thread with text of parent message
async function duplicateParentMessageText(parentMessageId, messageText) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${basePath}/v1/${appId}/conversations/replyto_${parentMessageId}/messages`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
      },

      body: JSON.stringify([
        {
          text: messageText,
          type: "SystemMessage",
        },
      ]),
    }
  );
  return response.json();
}

async function handleThreadCreation(
  parentMessageId,
  parentConvId,
  participants,
  messageText
) {
  const createThreadResponse = await createThread(
    parentMessageId,
    parentConvId,
    participants
  );

  const duplicateMessageResponse = await duplicateParentMessageText(
    parentMessageId,
    messageText
  );

  return {
    thread: createThreadResponse.data,
    duplicateMessage: duplicateMessageResponse.data,
  };
}
```

The `createThread` function creates or updates the thread on the backend, and adds the message ID and conversation ID of the parent message as [custom conversation properties](/Reference/Concepts/Conversations/#custom). We'll use these in later sections.

The `duplicateParentMessageText` function then calls the [send message](/Reference/REST_API/Messages/#send-a-message) REST API endpoint to send a system message that duplicates the text of the parent message, so that readers of the thread can see the message they're replying to.

## Add a back button

Currently, there's no way of getting back to the parent conversation from a thread. In this section, we'll fix this by updating the behavior of the left arrow icon button in the chat header.

Some steps are similar to the steps for setting up the **Reply** message action in the last section, so we'll move more quickly through these this time.

### Track the conversation history

Our **Reply in thread** feature allows nested threads: you can reply to a message in one of the original conversations in the team chat (a channel or DM conversation), and then reply to a message in that thread, and so on. We'll use a stack to keep track of the history of previous conversations you've viewed at your current depth in the nesting.

For example, if you're currently in a thread that's a reply to a message in another thread, your `historyStack` would look something like this:

```js
[
  {
    id: "remoteWorkMeetup",
    subject: "design",
    // ...
  },
  {
    id: "replyto_msg_<MESSAGE_ID>",
    subject: "Replies",
    // ...
  },
];
```

First we initialise the history stack in `TeamChat.jsx` as an empty array:

```jsx
const [historyStack, setHistoryStack] = useState([]);
```

We'll also add a `findConversation` helper function to allow us to find a conversation given its ID:

```jsx
const findConversation = (convId) => {
  const allConversations = [
    ...talkJsConfig.conversations.dms,
    ...talkJsConfig.conversations.channels,
  ];

  const foundConversation = allConversations.find((conv) => conv.id === convId);

  if (!foundConversation) {
    return {
      id: convId,
      subject: "Replies",
      avatar: "",
    };
  } else {
    return foundConversation;
  }
};
```

This function retrieves the conversation data in `talkJsConfig` for channels and DMs, and an object in the same format for threads, with a subject of "Replies".

Update the `replyInThread` to add the parent conversation to the stack when you select the thread:

```jsx
const replyInThread = (event) => {
  // ...

  if (session?.isAlive) {
    // ...

    setHistoryStack((prevStack) => [
      ...prevStack,
      findConversation(event.message.conversation.id),
    ]);
  }
};
```

Then, add a `goBack` function that switches you to the previous conversation and removes it from the stack:

```jsx
const goBack = () => {
  const conversation = historyStack[historyStack.length - 1];
  setHistoryStack((prevStack) => prevStack.slice(0, -1));

  if (session?.isAlive) {
    const talkJsConversation = session.getOrCreateConversation(conversation.id);
    const me = new Talk.User({
      id: talkJsConfig.userId,
      name: "Eulalia Van Helgen",
      photoUrl: "https://talkjs.com/new-web/avatar-7.jpg",
      role: "default",
    });
    talkJsConversation.setParticipant(me);

    setMobileChannelSelected(true);
    setCurrentConversation(conversation);

    if (chatboxRef.current?.isAlive) {
      chatboxRef.current.select(talkJsConversation);
    }
  }
};
```

We'll pass this through to the `ChatHeader` as a prop, which we'll use in the next section:

```jsx
<ChatHeader
  // ... other props ...
  goBack={goBack}
/>
```

### Update the chat header

In the chat header of our current team chat, we're already using a back button on smaller screens to go back to the conversation list:

!! 2-back-button.jpg

<figure class="kg-image-card">
  <img class="kg-image" src="<URL>" alt="The back button, a left arrow icon in the chat header."/>
  <figcaption>The back button</figcaption>
</figure>

We'll extend this behavior to also show the left arrow icon on all screens if an `isThread` flag (which we'll add below) is set:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => clickBackButton()}
  className={`mr-4 ${isThread ? "" : "lg:hidden"}`}
>
  <Icon.ChevronLeft size={25} />
</button>
```

We'll then call the `goBack` function from the previous section if the conversation is a thread:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const ChatHeader = ({
  conversation,
  goBack,
  mobileChannelSelected,
  setMobileChannelSelected,
}) => {
  const [isThread, setIsThread] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const threadPattern = "replyto_";
    if (conversation.id.startsWith(threadPattern)) {
      setIsThread(true);
    } else {
      setIsThread(false);
    }
  }, [conversation]);

  const clickBackButton = () => {
    if (isThread) {
      goBack();
    } else {
      setMobileChannelSelected(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    // ...
  );
};

```

## Add a reply count

We can now create threads and navigate through them. The final feature we need is a way to tell whether messages have replies without clicking through. To complete our threaded chat demo, we'll add a link below messages with replies that's labelled, say, **Replies (3)** if there are three replies.

### Enable the "message.sent" webhook

We'll need a way of updating the reply link when users add new messages to threads. To do this, weâ€™ll first enable TalkJS [webhooks](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Webhooks/), which allow the TalkJS server to notify your server when it sends a new message. Webhooks let you use an event-driven architecture, where you get told about events when they happen rather than having to constantly check for new messages.

Webhooks are server-side only, so you'll need to add a new `/updateReplyCount` endpoint to your existing server code to monitor incoming events from the TalkJS server:

```js
app.post("/update-reply-count", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).end();
});
```

Currently this endpoint just logs the event data when it receives a new message sent event.

For TalkJS to communicate with your server, you must expose it to the internet. To make this easy, weâ€™ll use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local server. See our tutorial on [How to integrate ngrok with TalkJS](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-integrate-ngrok-with-talkjs-to-receive-webhooks-locally/#setting-up-ngrok) for instructions on how to install ngrok.

Once you have installed ngrok, run the following command:

```sh
ngrok http 3001
```

This command starts a secure tunnel to your local port 3001. The output should include the URL that ngrok exposes:

```sh
Forwarding                    https://<YOUR_SITE>.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3001
```

Then enable the webhook with the following steps:

1.  Go to the **Settings** tab of the TalkJS dashboard.
2.  Enable the `message.sent` option in the **Webhooks** section of the TalkJS dashboard.
3.  Add the ngrok URL to **Webhook URLs** in the TalkJS dashboard, including the `update-reply-count` path: `https://<YOUR-URL>.ngrok.io/update-reply-count`

TalkJS will now send a web request to your server when a message is sent. To test this, write another message in your chat UI. You should see the event logged to your server's console.

### Add a custom reply count property

Next, we'll add a reply count as a [custom message property](https://talkjs.com/docs/Reference/Concepts/Messages/#custom) on the parent message that the thread replies to.

Update your `/update-reply-count` endpoint code with the following:

```js
// Update parent message with a reply count custom field
async function updateReplyCount(messageId, conversationId, count) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${basePath}/v1/${appId}/conversations/${conversationId}/messages/${messageId}`,
    {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${secretKey}`,
      },

      body: JSON.stringify({
        custom: { replyCount: count.toString() },
      }),
    }
  );
  return response.json();
}

// Endpoint for webhook listener for reply counts
app.post("/update-reply-count", async (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body.data;
  const conversationId = data.conversation.id;
  const messageType = data.message.type;

  if (conversationId.startsWith("replyto_") && messageType === "UserMessage") {
    const { parentMessageId, parentConvId } = data.conversation.custom;

    const response = await getMessages(parentMessageId);
    const messages = await response.data;

    const messageCount = messages.data.length;

    // Ignore the first message in thread (it's a repeat of the parent message)
    if (messageCount > 1) {
      await updateReplyCount(parentMessageId, parentConvId, messageCount - 1);
    }
  }
});
```

Now, when the webhook listener receives new user messages from a thread (a conversation with an ID starting with "replyto\_"), it will call `getMessages`, which we introduced earlier, to get the count of messages in the thread. It then calls the `updateReplyCount` function to update the parent message with a `replyCount` custom message property with the current number of replies, ignoring the duplicated parent message at the top of the thread.

### Update your theme to display replies

The final step is to display the reply count in the chat UI. TalkJS allows you to [use conditionals](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Themes/Editing_Component_Templates/#rendering-conditionally) and [access custom properties](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Themes/Passing_Data_to_Themes/#storing-custom-data-in-users-conversations-and-messages) in your templates. Combining these ideas, we'll create an [action link](/Features/Customizations/Action_Buttons_Links/#actions-in-the-theme-editor) that says, for example, **1 reply** if the `replyCount` custom property has a value of 1 or **3 replies** if it has a value of 3. If there are no replies or the message is a welcome message, we won't include the link.

In the **UserMessage** section of your `team_chat` theme, add the following to the bottom of the template, below the emoji reactions div:

```html
<div t:if="{{ isWelcomeMessage }}"></div>
<div t:else>
  <ActionLink
    t:if="{{ custom.replyCount > 1 }}"
    class="reply-box-link"
    action="replyInThread"
  >
    <div class="reply-box">
      <a class="reply-box-link">{{ custom.replyCount }} replies</a>

Finally, we'll add some styling. See [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/team-chat-with-threads/theme/UserMessage.txt) for the full **UserMessage** template with added styles.

You should now have something that looks like this:

!! 3-team-chat.jpg

<figure class="kg-image-card">
  <img class="kg-image" src="<URL>" alt="The finished chat, showing a message with three replies"/>
  <figcaption>The finished chat</figcaption>
</figure>

## Conclusion

You now have a working demonstration of a team chat with channels and reply threads! To recap, in this tutorial you have:

- added a **Reply in thread** message action
- used the REST API to create new threads
- updated the **Back** button to take you back to the parent conversation
- used webhooks and custom data to add a reply count

For the full example code for this tutorial, see our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/team-chat-with-threads).
